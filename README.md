# mm4-patches
A collection of custom ARM Assembly and C patches specifically written for "Choose Your Chaos", the fourth MysteryMail event. The featured code contains heavy spoilers for the event, so view at your own risk!

Patches were written by various contributors:
- Adex (me? cringe)
- [HeckaBad](https://github.com/Jawshoeuh)
- [marius851000](https://github.com/marius851000)
- [sudzoof](https://github.com/sudzoof)

Skypatches may not have the proper description or "Applied" functionality (mainly due to my sheer laziness).

All patches were designed with the NA/US version in mind and likely do/will not have EU or JP support.
